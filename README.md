## Fernando-pr - Branch push troubleshooting
Added line 45 to push to Fernando-pr branch. 

While attempting to push the README.md edits to the appropriate branch, I ran into some issues, but they were fixed by:
- Creating a new branch with an easily writeable name in terminal.
- Switched the branch I was pushing to from *master to Fernando-pr (new branch).

However, before this, I went through a pain of troubleshooting from Google searches, which advised  I used git pull, and other commands that did not work. In the end, after thorough research, I figured it all out.
